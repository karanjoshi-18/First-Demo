** Git Config :- **
Global Git config controls settings for the currently logged-in user and all their repositories.
Local Git config controls settings for a specific repository.


** Clone and Status :- **

Remote = GitHub (or any online server).
Local = Your PC or laptop.

clone = Copy repository from remote (GitHub) to local (your PC).
status = Shows the current state of the local repository (i.e., what changes have been made).


Untracked → New files that Git doesn’t know about.
Example: You create a new file newfile.txt.

Modified → If you change an existing file (already tracked by Git).
Example: You edit an existing file file1.txt.

Staged → After running git add <file>, the file moves to the staging area, ready for the next commit.
Example: You run git add file1.txt and git add newfile.txt.

Unmodified (Post-commit) → After committing, the file is now unmodified again because it's committed to the repository, and there are no changes since the last commit.
Example: You run git commit -m "Commit message", and now file1.txt and newfile.txt are back to an unmodified state.



Scenario 1: Add a New File (newfile.txt) and Update Existing File (already.txt) to an Existing GitHub Repository

Scenario Setup:

GitHub Repository: demo-repo

Local Folder: depoRepo (this is the local folder where your project files are located)


Steps:

1. Link the Local Folder (depoRepo) to the GitHub Repository (demo-repo):

First, navigate to your local folder:

cd path/to/depoRepo

Initialize a Git repository in this folder (if not already done):

git init

Link the local folder to the remote repository on GitHub:

git remote add origin https://github.com/username/demo-repo.git

Replace https://github.com/username/demo-repo.git with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.




2. Make Changes in Your Local Folder:

Add a new file: newfile.txt.

Modify the existing file: already.txt.



3. Check Git Status:

git status

Git will show newfile.txt as untracked.

Git will show already.txt as modified.



4. Stage the Changes:

git add .

This stages both the new file (newfile.txt) and the modified file (already.txt).



5. Commit the Changes:

git commit -m "Added newfile.txt and updated already.txt"


6. Push the Changes to GitHub:

git push origin main

Now, both newfile.txt and the updated already.txt will be pushed to the GitHub repository (demo-repo).

Scenario 2: Add a Local Project Folder to an Empty GitHub Repository

Scenario Setup:

GitHub Repository: project (empty repository on GitHub)

Local Folder: projectFolder (the folder on your local machine with project files)


Steps:

1. Navigate to the Local Project Folder:

Go to the directory where your project files are located:

cd path/to/projectFolder



2. Initialize a Git Repository in the Local Folder:

If this folder is not already a Git repository, initialize it:

git init



3. Stage All Project Files:

Add all the files in your project to Git:

git add .



4. Commit the Files:

git commit -m "Initial commit"


5. Add the Remote Repository:

Link your local repository to the empty GitHub repository:

git remote add origin https://github.com/username/project.git

Replace https://github.com/username/project.git with the actual URL of your empty GitHub repository.




6. Push the Project to GitHub:

git push -u origin main

This will upload your local project files to the empty GitHub repository (project).





---

General Notes:

Check the status of your repository:

git status

Stage files:

To stage all files:

git add .

To stage specific files:

git add file_name


Commit changes:

git commit -m "Your commit message"

Push changes to GitHub:

git push origin main

Add a remote repository:

git remote add origin <repo-link>

Summary of Key Concepts:

In Scenario 1, you are linking an already existing local folder (depoRepo) to a GitHub repository (demo-repo) and then pushing changes to it.

In Scenario 2, you are pushing an entire project from a local folder (projectFolder) to a new, empty GitHub repository (project).


Now both scenarios are clear with the local folder and GitHub repository links explained properly.
